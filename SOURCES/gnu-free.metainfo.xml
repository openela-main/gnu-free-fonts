    <p>
      Gnu FreeFont is a free family of scalable outline fonts, suitable for general
      use on computers and for desktop publishing. It is Unicode-encoded for
      compatibility with all modern operating systems.
 
      Besides a full set of characters for writing systems based on the Latin
      alphabet, FreeFont contains large selection of characters from other writing
      systems some of which are hard to find elsewhere.

      FreeFont also contains a large set of symbol characters, both technical and
      decorative. We are especially pleased with the Mathematical Operators range,
      with which most of the glyphs used in LaTeX can be displayed.
